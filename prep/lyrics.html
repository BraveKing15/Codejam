            Standing here in Your presence
            In a grace so relentless
            I am won 
            By perfect love
        
            Wrapped within the arms of heaven 
            In a peace that lasts forever 
            Sinking deep 
            In mercy's sea 

            I'm wide awake 
            Drawing close 
            Stirred by grace 
            And all my heart is Yours 
            All fear removed 
            I breathe You in 
            I lean into Your love
            Oh, Your love 

            When I'm lost You pursue me 
            Lift my head to see Your glory 
            Lord of all 
            So beautiful 

            Here in You I find shelter
            Captivated by the splendor
            Of Your face
            My secret place

            I'm wide awake 
            Drawing close
            Stirred by grace
            And all my heart is Yours
            All fear removed
            I breathe You in
            I lean into Your love
            Oh, Your love

            Your love so deep
            Jesus Christ
            You are my one desire
            Lord hear my only cry
            To know You all my life

            Love so deep 
            Is washing over me
            Your face is all I seek 
            You are my everything 
            Jesus Christ
            You are my one desire 
            Lord hear my only cry 
            To know You all my life 

            I'm wide awake
            Drawing close
            Stirred by grace
            And all my heart is Yours
            All fear removed
            I breathe You in
            I lean into Your love
            Oh, Your love
